\chapter*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}
Modern day cold atom experiments consist of a low density gas of non-interacting particles. Temperature extraction via the grand canonical ensemble fails to accurately describe a gas in this regime since it is a canonical system outside the thermodynamic limit. Previous attempts were made to connect the two ensembles, but suffer from numerical instability or only work for specific spectra. In this project we present a recursive solution that is numerically stable and can be applied to a general trap spectrum. This method is benchmarked against exact solutions to prove its consistency. Degenerate cases are also considered theoretically and cross checked numerically to find agreement.
