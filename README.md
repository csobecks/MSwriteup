# MSwriteup

This is my writeup for my Masters of Physics from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The final draft is what was submitted to my committee, and the trace submission is the proper formatting for submission to UTK's TRACE site. This document was constructed in overleaf, so if there is an issue compiling the file try to use overleaf to view this document.
