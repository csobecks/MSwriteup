year = {1998}, 
title = {{History and outlook of statistical physics}}, 
author = {Flamm, D}, 
journal = {arXiv}, 
eprint = {physics/9803005}, 
abstract = {{This paper gives a short review of the history of statistical physics starting from D. Bernoulli's kinetic theory of gases in the 18th century until the recent new developments in nonequilibrium kinetic theory in the last decades of this century. The most important contributions of the great physicists Clausius, Maxwell and Boltzmann are sketched. It is shown how the reversibility and the recurrence paradox are resolved within Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. An approach to classical and quantum statistical mechanics is outlined. Finally the progress in nonequilibrium kinetic theory in the second half of this century is sketched starting from the work of N.N. Bogolyubov in 1946 up to the progress made recently in understanding the diffusion processes in dense fluids using computer simulations and analytical methods.}},

abstract = {{The theoretical description of interacting fermions in one spatial dimension is simplified by the fact that the low‐energy excitations can be described in terms of bosonic degrees of freedom. This fermion–boson transmutation (FBT) which lies at the heart of the Luttinger liquid concept is presented in a way which does not require a knowledge of quantum fieldtheoretical methods. As the basic facts can already be introduced for noninteracting fermions they are mainly discussed. As an application we use the FBT to present exact results for the low‐temperature thermodynamics and the occupation numbers in the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble. They are compared with the standard grand canonical results.}},

This general framework introduces the concept of auxiliary partition functions, and represents a unification of previous distinct approaches with many known results appearing as direct consequences of the developed mathematical structure. In addition, we introduce a general decomposition of the correlations between occupation numbers in terms of the occupation numbers of individual energy levels, that is valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate spectra. To demonstrate the applicability of the theory in the presence of degeneracy, we compute energy-level correlations up to fourth order in a bosonic ring in the presence of a magnetic field.}},

We first discuss some physical motivations, providing a quantitative assessment of the need for deep quantum degeneracy in relevant physics cases, such as the search for unconventional superfluid states. Attention is then focused on the most widespread technique to reach deep quantum degeneracy for Fermi systems, sympathetic cooling of Bose-Fermi mixtures, organizing the discussion according to the specific species involved. Various proposals to circumvent some of the limitations on achieving the deepest Fermi degeneracy, and their experimental realizations, are then reviewed. Finally, we discuss the extension of these techniques to optical lattices and the implementation of precision thermometry crucial to the understanding of the phase diagram of classical and quantum phase transitions in Fermi gases.}},

In the momentum distribution of a spin-polarized gas, we observe the emergence of the Fermi surface and the saturated occupation of one particle per momentum state: the striking consequence of Pauli blocking in momentum space for a degenerate gas. Cooling a spin-balanced Fermi gas at unitarity, we create homogeneous superfluids and observe spatially uniform pair condensates. For thermodynamic measurements, we introduce a hybrid potential that is harmonic in one dimension and uniform in the other two. The spatially resolved compressibility reveals the superfluid transition in a spin-balanced Fermi gas, saturation in a fully polarized Fermi gas, and strong attraction in the polaronic regime of a partially polarized Fermi gas.}},

We realize highly elongated traps with box-like confinement along the long, axial direction combined with conventional harmonic confinement along the two radial directions. The design, fabrication and characterization of the atom chip and the box traps are described. We load ultracold ( 1 µK) clouds of 87Rb in a box trap, and demonstrate Bose-gas focusing as a means to characterize these atomic clouds in arbitrarily shaped potentials. Our results show that box-like axial potentials on atom chips are very promising for studies of one-dimensional quantum gases.}, number={15}, journal={Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics}, author={Es, J J P van and Wicke, P and Amerongen, A H van and Rétif, C and Whitlock, S and Druten, N J van}, year={2010}, pages={155002} }
