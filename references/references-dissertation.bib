abstract = {{This paper gives a short review of the history of statistical physics starting from D. Bernoulli's kinetic theory of gases in the 18th century until the recent new developments in nonequilibrium kinetic theory in the last decades of this century. The most important contributions of the great physicists Clausius, Maxwell and Boltzmann are sketched. It is shown how the reversibility and the recurrence paradox are resolved within Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. An approach to classical and quantum statistical mechanics is outlined. Finally the progress in nonequilibrium kinetic theory in the second half of this century is sketched starting from the work of N.N. Bogolyubov in 1946 up to the progress made recently in understanding the diffusion processes in dense fluids using computer simulations and analytical methods.}},

abstract = {{We review the status of cooling techniques aimed at achieving the deepest quantum degeneracy for atomic Fermi gases. We first discuss some physical motivations, providing a quantitative assessment of the need for deep quantum degeneracy in relevant physics cases, such as the search for unconventional superfluid states. Attention is then focused on the most widespread technique to reach deep quantum degeneracy for Fermi systems, sympathetic cooling of Bose-Fermi mixtures, organizing the discussion according to the specific species involved. Various proposals to circumvent some of the limitations on achieving the deepest Fermi degeneracy, and their experimental realizations, are then reviewed. Finally, we discuss the extension of these techniques to optical lattices and the implementation of precision thermometry crucial to the understanding of the phase diagram of classical and quantum phase transitions in Fermi gases.}},

We realize highly elongated traps with box-like confinement along the long, axial direction combined with conventional harmonic confinement along the two radial directions. The design, fabrication and characterization of the atom chip and the box traps are described. We load ultracold ( 1 µK) clouds of 87Rb in a box trap, and demonstrate Bose-gas focusing as a means to characterize these atomic clouds in arbitrarily shaped potentials. Our results show that box-like axial potentials on atom chips are very promising for studies of one-dimensional quantum gases.}, number={15}, journal={Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics}, author={Es, J J P van and Wicke, P and Amerongen, A H van and Rétif, C and Whitlock, S and Druten, N J van}, year={2010}, pages={155002} }

@ARTICLE{Bhar, title={Measurements and analysis of response function of cold atoms in optical molasses}, volume={1}, DOI={10.1364/optcon.448535}, abstractNote={We report our experimental measurements and theoretical analysis of the position response function of a cloud of cold atoms residing in the viscous medium of an optical molasses and confined by a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We measure the position response function by applying a transient homogeneous magnetic field as a perturbing force. We observe a transition from a damped oscillatory motion to an over-damped relaxation, stemming from a competition between the viscous drag provided by the optical molasses and the restoring force of the MOT. Our observations are in both qualitative and quantitative agreement with the predictions of a theoretical model based on the Langevin equation. As a consistency check, and as a prototype for future experiments, we also study the free diffusive spreading of the atomic cloud in our optical molasses with the confining magnetic field of the MOT turned off. We find that the measured value of the diffusion coefficient agrees with the value predicted by our Langevin model, using the damping coefficient. The damping coefficient was deduced from our measurements of the position response function at the same temperature.}, number={2}, journal={Optics Continuum}, author={Bhar, Subhajit and Swar, Maheswar and Satpathi, Urbashi and Sinha, Supurna and Sorkin, Rafael and Chaudhuri, Saptarishi and Roy, Sanjukta}, year={2022}, pages={171} }

@phdthesis{Viering, title={Experiments to Control Atom Number and Phase-Space Density in cold Gases}, abstractNote={This dissertation presents the development and implementation of two novel experimental techniques for controlling atom number and phase-space density in cold atomic gases. The first experiment demonstrates the method of single-photon cooling, an optical realization of Maxwell’s demon, using an ensemble of rubidium atoms. Single-photon cooling increases the phase-space density of a cloud of magnetically trapped atoms, reducing the entropy of the ensemble by irreversibly transferring atoms through a oneway wall via a single-photon scattering event. While traditional laser cooling methods are limited in their applicability to a small number of atoms, single-photon cooling is much more general and should in principle be applicable to almost all atoms in the periodic table. The experiment described in this dissertation demonstrates a one-dimensional implementation of the cooling scheme. Complete phase-space compression along this dimension is observed. The limitations on the cooling performance are shown to be given by trap dynamics in the magnetic trap. The second part of this dissertation is dedicated to the experiment built to control the atom number of a degenerate Fermi gas on a single particle level. Creating Fock states of atoms with ultra-high fidelity is a mandatory step for studying quantum entanglement on a single atom level. The experimental technique implemented to control the atom number in this experiment is called laser culling. Decreasing the trapping potential reduces the atom number in a controlled way, giving precise control over the number of atoms remaining in the trap. This dissertation details the design and construction of this experiment and reports on the progress towards the creation of neutral lithium Fock states.}, author={Viering, Kirsten}, year={2012}, month={Aug} }

@article{Radwell, title={Ultra high densities of cold atoms in a holographically controlled dark SPOT trap}, abstractNote={We demonstrate an atom trap geometry for 87Rb which is capable of producing ultra high atom densities. Reradiation forces, which usually limit high densities, can be avoided in dark spontaneous-force optical traps (dark SPOTs) by sheltering atoms from intense trapping light. Here we demonstrate a dynamic implementation of a dark SPOT, resulting in an increase in atom density by almost two orders of magnitude up to 1.3x10^12cm-3. Holographic control of the trapping beams and dynamic switching between MOT and dark SPOT configuration allows us to optimise the trapping geometry. We have identified the ideal size of the dark core to be six times larger than the MOT. Our method also avoids unwanted heating so that we reach a record phase-space density for a MOT.}, journal={arXiv}, author={Radwell, Neal and Walker, Graeme and Franke-Arnold, Sonja}, year={2013} }

We theoretically examine the influence of the probe beam shape and its distance from the initial position of the cloud on the temperature evaluation. These results are then verified with a three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation and applied to our experimental data to show that the proposed procedure allows accurate and reliable determination of the temperature.},

As the basic facts can already be introduced for noninteracting fermions they are mainly discussed. As an application we use the FBT to present exact results for the low‐temperature thermodynamics and the occupation numbers in the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble. They are compared with the standard grand canonical results.}},

In addition, we introduce a general decomposition of the correlations between occupation numbers in terms of the occupation numbers of individual energy levels, that is valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate spectra. To demonstrate the applicability of the theory in the presence of degeneracy, we compute energy-level correlations up to fourth order in a bosonic ring in the presence of a magnetic field.}},

Cooling a spin-balanced Fermi gas at unitarity, we create homogeneous superfluids and observe spatially uniform pair condensates. For thermodynamic measurements, we introduce a hybrid potential that is harmonic in one dimension and uniform in the other two. The spatially resolved compressibility reveals the superfluid transition in a spin-balanced Fermi gas, saturation in a fully polarized Fermi gas, and strong attraction in the polaronic regime of a partially polarized Fermi gas.}},
