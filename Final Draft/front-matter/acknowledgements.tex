\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Professor Adrian Del Maestro for his mentorship, sharing of expertise, and for investing in me. His direction of my efforts throughout this project has been an invaluable benefit to my education.  I would also like to thank Dr. Hatem Barghathi for all his help throughout this process. Any success that I have had throughout this project was due to his knowledge and experience. I am forever grateful for the time he has taken to help me with understanding the background theory and finding bugs in my code. Finally, I would like to thank the Del Maestro group for welcoming me in and helping me throughout this writing process with useful notes and corrections.
