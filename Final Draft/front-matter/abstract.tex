\chapter*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}
Modern day cold atom experiments consist of a low density gas of very weakly-interacting particles. Temperature extraction via the grand canonical ensemble fails to accurately describe a gas in this regime since it is a canonical system outside the thermodynamic limit. Previous attempts  to connect the two ensembles suffer from numerical instabilities or only work for specific trap configurations. In this project, we present a recursive solution that is numerically stable and can be applied to a general trap spectrum. This method is benchmarked against exact solutions to prove its consistency. For the case of traps that produce degenerate single-particle energy levels for the atoms in the gas, we identify a regime where the choice of ensemble can have a significant effect on the extracted temperature through a statistical mechanical analysis.
